	<p class="p2">The name <i>Caledonia</i> stems from the prominent role that it plays in the life and career of Van Morrison.  <i>Caledonia</i> is the name of his production company, his daughter's middle name, and the name of his backup group, to name just a few references. Its modern usage is as a romantic or poetic name for Scotland as a whole.</p>

	<p class="p2"><i>Caledonia</i> is a smart phone application that allows clientele the ability to participate in the selection of music at venues such as bars, clubs, restaurants, private parties, etc.  The application provides "host" capabilities, giving the venue complete control over the music that's allowed to be played and ultimately, added to the queue. Once the parameters for the queue are created, clientele will then be able to add their own selections, as long as the selections adhere to the queue's parameters.</p>

	<p class="p2">Beyond allowing clientele the ability to play their own songs, <i>Caledonia</i> has revolutionized the process of music discovery. Rather than relying on "music experts" and algorithms, like most streaming services do, we rely on a formalized version of human interaction. <i>Caledonia</i> utilizes a proprietary technology that connects users based on song matching and song overlap within libraries and playlists. It uses its song matching tool to locate users who have similar playlists; more specifically, playlists that include over a certain percentage of the same songs. And as playlists are continuously updated with newly discovered songs, the music discovery is endless.</p>
